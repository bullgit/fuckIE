# fuckIE
If my users are using IE, they don't need my beautiful code right ?

## How

link to `fuckie.js` in your html document, either downloaded locally or from github

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/fuckie.js"></script>
```

## What

When the browser is Internet Explorer or Edge (not the user agent), the site will not display any CSS
